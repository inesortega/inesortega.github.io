Since 2022 I am a Technical Manager of Data Analytics and AI at the Security and Privacy department of the Galician Research and Development Centre for Advanced Telecommunications (GRADIANT), where I manage and develop R&D projects on the use of AI techniques to address cybersecurity and data privacy issues. 


I am currently a PhD student at the University of Vigo, and I hold a M.Sc degree in Cybersecurity and a B.Sc degree in Computer Science from Carlos III University of Madrid. My main research activities are on the development of new techniques and algorithms related to data analytics, in particular in machine learning to solve cybersecurity and privacy problems, anomaly detection, computational statistics, and privacy preserving AI. During this period and as part of my learning process in the field of cyber-attack mitigation for industrial environments, I carried out a predoctoral research stay at the Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering at Sapienza University of Rome (Italy).


Before joining GRADIANT I worked for about 2 years at the Microsoft Canada Development Centre as a Software Engineer, developing solutions to process (big)data from Windows telemetry in near real time, as part of the Core Data Engineering group, and as a Research Assistant at Carlos III University of Madrid in the University Group for Identification Technologies, developing software solutions for the analysis and processing of biometric data.
