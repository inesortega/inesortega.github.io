## Abstract
The goal of the PRESERVE project is to design, implement and validate a privacy-preserving law enforcement and support decision platform by leveraging Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) such as Federated Learning (FL) and AI-based models, such as User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA). This system aims to proactively detect and prevent cybercrime and terrorism while safeguarding individual privacy, ensuring unbiased policing, and adhering to the EU's ethical standards for AI. By facilitating secure, cross-border collaboration among law enforcement authorities, PRESERVE seeks to enhance the allocation of police resources, improve proactive threat detection and response, and provide a regulation compliant model for the responsible use of AI in crime detection and prevention.
