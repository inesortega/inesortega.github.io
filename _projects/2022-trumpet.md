The transition from cancer patient to cancer survivor should be planned and coordinated to ensure patients receive high-quality, coordinated and personalised care. The EU-funded PERSIST project is developing a system that supports self-care and can identify outcomes that require professional intervention. Its system uses big data technology and novel analysis algorithms that can be easily integrated into electronic health records and other sources of clinical data. Overall, the project aims to improve the management, intervention and prevention strategies to reduce side effects and prevent secondary diseases. Its long-term goal is to reduce the socio-economic burden related to cancer survivors’ care by creating a dynamic decision support system and making maximum use of predictive models.
