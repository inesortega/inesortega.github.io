Abstract
======
Big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) are essential in our data-driven environment – in all facets of daily life. However, many financial or insurance institutions still face difficulties using big data technology due to complicated regulations and the lack of testbed resources. The EU-funded INFINITECH project will undertake an innovative effort to boost regulatory compliance and enhance directed investments. Leaders in finance and ICT will aim to provide novel Big Data/IoT/AI technologies for managing and querying all kinds of data along with data governance capabilities. These disruptive tools will enhance innovations in business sectors and support nine novelty testbeds and sandboxes to offer open application programming interfaces (APIs).
