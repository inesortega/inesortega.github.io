As the landscape of industrial control systems (ICS) evolves, the security vulnerabilities inherent in these systems
have become increasingly important. In response to this escalating situation, in this paper, we present the development of
a virtualised cybersecurity research testbed tailored for these environments. Addressing the challenge of limited access to
proprietary OT network data for research purposes, our work proposes a comprehensive framework for simulating industrial
environments, aiming to facilitate the development and testing of cybersecurity solutions by providing functionalities for network
traffic logging, attack impact simulation, generation of labelled multivariate time series sensor datasets, among others, bridging
the gap between theoretical research and practical application needs.
