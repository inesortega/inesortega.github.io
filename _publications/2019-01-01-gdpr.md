title: "How to implement EU data protection regulation for R&D in biometrics"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-01-01-gdpr
excerpt: 'Biometrics R&D has to deal with personal data. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, privacy of a human being shall be protected, and this is addressed in different ways in each region of the world. In the case of the European Union, Data Protection Directives, Laws and Regulations have been established, and interpreted in different ways by each European Member State. Such a diversity has pushed the European Union to generate an improved regulation that will be mandatory from May 2018. Biometric R&D shall not only comply with the current Directive, but also has to adapt its work to the new Regulation. This work is intended to describe the situation and provide a recommended procedure when having to acquire personal data. The recommended procedure is illustrated by the implementation of a Biometric Data Acquisition Platform, used to acquire fingerprints from nearly 600 citizens using different sensors.'

Biometrics R&D has to deal with personal data. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, privacy of a human being shall be protected, and this is addressed in different ways in each region of the world. In the case of the European Union, Data Protection Directives, Laws and Regulations have been established, and interpreted in different ways by each European Member State. Such a diversity has pushed the European Union to generate an improved regulation that will be mandatory from May 2018. Biometric R&D shall not only comply with the current Directive, but also has to adapt its work to the new Regulation. This work is intended to describe the situation and provide a recommended procedure when having to acquire personal data. The recommended procedure is illustrated by the implementation of a Biometric Data Acquisition Platform, used to acquire fingerprints from nearly 600 citizens using different sensors.
